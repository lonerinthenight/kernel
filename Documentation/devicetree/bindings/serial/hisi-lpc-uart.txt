* Hisilicon hip06 UART through low-pin-count

Required properties:
- compatible : "hisilicon,lpc-uart", "ns16550a"
- clock-frequency: mandatory. It is 1843200.
- reg : the resource ranges for this device.
		I/O range is mandatory.
		memory range is optional. If flat-tree earlycon is to be used,
		it is mandatory and must populate the first reg property.
- reg-names : optional. name the uart resources.
		"lpc_mem" represents memory resource of the LPC parent. When
		flat-tree earlycon is needed, this memory resource and
		resource name are mandatory. Otherwise they are optional;
		"dev_io" represents I/O resource of this device. It is
		mandatory to access this device;

Clock handling:
  The clock rate of this device is same as the 8250 default clock rate, that
  is 1843200.

Note:
  This device depends on its parent device whose compatible string is
  "hisilicon,low-pin-count".

  The format of "reg" property follows the I/O space definition in ISA/EISA
  binding specification linked to:
  http://www.firmware.org/1275/bindings/isa/isa0_4d.ps

Example:

	uart0: lpc-uart@2f8 {
		compatible = "hisilicon,lpc-uart", "ns16550a";
		clock-frequency = <1843200>;
		reg = <0x00 0xa01b0000 0x1000>,
			<0x01 0x2f8 0x08>;
		status = "disabled";
	};


Example with low-pin-count parent device:

	isa@a01b0000 {
		compatible = "hisilicon,low-pin-count";
		#address-cells = <2>;
		#size-cells = <1>;
		reg = <0x0 0xa01b0000 0x0 0x1000>;
		ranges = <0x00 0xa01b0000 0x00 0xa01b0000 0x1000>;

		ipmi0: bt@e4 {
			compatible = "ipmi-bt";
			device_type = "ipmi";
			reg = <0x01 0xe4 0x04>;
			reg-names = "dev_io";
			status = "disabled";
		};

		uart0: lpc-uart@2f8 {
			compatible = "hisilicon,lpc-uart", "ns16550a";
			clock-frequency = <1843200>;
			reg =  <0x00 0xa01b0000 0x1000>,
				<0x01 0x2f8 0x08>;
			ret-names = "lpc_mem", "dev_io";
			status = "disabled";
		};
	};
